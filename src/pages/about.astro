						Welcome! I’m Grace, a Computer Science student at the University of Waterloo. My tech journey began with a passion for developing games, and now I’m interested in expanding my horizons and venturing into artificial intelligence, bioinformatics, and aerospace engineering.
					</a></p>
					<p>
						Starting in high school, I gained 3+ years of programming experience with various web and game projects. I enjoyed working with code, and building projects with teams of like-minded people encourage me to improve myself constantly. By honing my skills in multiple programming languages and frameworks, I aspire to craft innovative applications and help revolutionize the future.
My interest in technology and science also inspired me to delve into machine learning, neural networks, control systems, and aerospace technologies. It is a dream of mine to contribute to AI and humanity’s exploration of the cosmos.
					</p>
					<p>
						My current motivations are to remain curious and open-minded, shape my career through perseverance, and grow as a person. 
					</p>
					<p>I am determined to make a meaningful impact. If you would like to discuss new opportunities or have a light-hearted chat, feel free to contact me anytime!</p>
