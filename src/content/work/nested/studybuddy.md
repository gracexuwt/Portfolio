> Study with Starry, your friendly study partner

StudyBuddy is a studying tool that assists learners in becoming more productive and motivated.

Together with a friend, I designed and developed the learning application to help us keep focus while studying. I was involved in all stages of web development, including frontend UI design and Javascript backend. Specifically, I designed and programmed the pomodoro timer, stopwatch, and event calendar. After deployment of the website, I tested the functions and addressed several run-time bugs regarding the pomodoro timer session changes, calendar date, and server issues.
