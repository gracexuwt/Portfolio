#### Watolink

Watolink is the University of Waterlooâ€™s Neurotech design team, and our team develops BCI hardware, applications, and sensor technology using EEG signal analysis.

#### Gaming Team - Designer & Developer

As a core member of Watolink, I worked on the BCI gaming project. The BCI gaming project aims to create an interactive video game that people with motor disabilities, such as ataxia, could engage in. Currently, the BCI gaming team is developing a Western and Sci-Fi themed 2D platformer game.

I contributed to the project both as a programmer and a designer. Within the Unity environment, I coded 2D RigidBody collisions, player movement, health bars, death sequences, and other game mechanics in C#. 

Finally, I designed and animated the main character, enemies, and bosses using Medibang Paint, PhotoShop, and Unity Animator.

#### Brain Computer Interface

Other than game development, we gathered EEG-based data on blinking, concentration, and other measurable indicators using Neurosity headsets. After gathering data, we referenced the Brainflow biosensor library to parse and analyze the EEG data, then integrate the headset data into Unity by translating Python code to C#. We are working to collaborate with the Machine Learning research team to assess user adjustment and classification models, ensuring a quality gaming experience for a wide range of individuals.
