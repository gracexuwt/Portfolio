Crystal Adventure is a leisure game where the protagonist Crystal rescues animals from the adoption centre.

As the developer and planner of the game, I coded the shop and inventory systems, currency system, achievements menu, cheats, interactive elements like buttons, and all the mini games, including Spin The Wheel, Rock Paper Scissors against Bingo the Monkey, Adventure Stories across different habitats, and math trivia at MeowMills Middle School. I also troubleshooted the game to deliver an error-free gaming experience.

To beat the game, rescue the animals and earn all achievements! 
> Animals are our friends,
> your mission is to rescue!
